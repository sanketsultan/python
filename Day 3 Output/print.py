# The print() function in Python is used to display output on the console. It takes one or more arguments and prints them as a string. It is a commonly used function for debugging and displaying information to the user.

print("show this in the console")

#you can run this program by typing python print.py in the terminal or command prompt.

# Output: show this in the console

#thing to note here is that the print function is a built-in function in python and does not require any import statement to be used.

#also, if you notice it use () this paranthesis to take the input and print it. if we use [] or {} it will throw an error.
